## Question
Test for the significance of the school fixed effects. Under what conditions would we expect the inclusion of significant fixed effects to have little influence on the coefficient estimates of remaining variables?

## Solution
The F-test statistic is 16.70. The  $F_{(0.95,78,5681)} = 1.2798$ so that we reject the null hypothesis that 
there are no significant differences between schools. If the school indicator variables are 
uncorrelated with the included explanatory variables then their inclusion, or exclusion, should 
have little effect on the regression estimates.
