### **Question**

Estimate the log-linear model $ln(price)= \beta_1 + \beta_2SQFT + e$. Interpret the estimated model parameters. Calculate the slope and elasticity at the sample means, if necessary.

### answer:

In this model, two parameters are estimated.

The explanation of the two variables is as follows.

 $\beta_1$=4.39 ,  $\beta_2$=0.036   $\bar{PRICE}$=250.24   $\bar{SQFT}$=27.28 

When $SQFT$ = 0, the value of $ln(PRICE)$ is 4.40. This means that if $SQFT$ = 0, $ln(PRICE)$ has a basic value of 4.40.

When $SQFT$ increase by 1 unit, on average, $PRICE$ will increase by 0.036 percent.

At the sample mean, the slope is  $\frac{dy}{dx}$  = $\beta_2 \cdot \bar{y}= 9.02$  and the elasticity is 
$\frac{dy}{dx} \cdot \frac{\bar{x}}{\bar{y}} = \text{slope} \cdot \frac{\bar{x}}{\bar{y}}$  = 0.98.

## **ch15.6(c)**

### **Question:**

column (3) contains the estimated fixed effects model specified in part (b). Compare these estimates with the OLS estimates. Which coefficients, apart from the intercepts, show the most
difference?

## Answer:

Using 95% interval estimates for the fixed effects (FE)

|  | upper bound | lower bound | OLS1987 | OLS1988 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| $EXPER$ | -0.00718 | 0.12218 | 0.127 | 0.1265 |
| $EXPER^2$ | -0.00336 | 0.000956 | -0.0033 | -0.0031 |
| $SOUTH$ | -0.57267 | -0.07953 | -0.2128 | -0.2384 |
| $UNION$ | 0.021048 | 0.143352 | 0.1445 | 0.1102 |

The  $EXPER$ coefficient estimated using OLS exceeded the 95% confidence interval.Therefore, the $EXPER$ coefficient shows a most significant difference between the OLS estimation and the FE estimation.

## **ch15.6(d)**

### **Question:**

The F-statistic for the null hypothesis that there are no individual differences, equation (15.20),
is 11.68. What are the degrees of freedom of the F-distribution if the null hypothesis (15.19) is
true? What is the 1% level of significance critical value for the test? What do you conclude about
the null hypothesis.

## Answer:

$N=716 ,T=2, K_s=4$

Suppose the F-statistic value is $11.68$ and null hypothesis is consider as true, at 1% level of the significance,the degree of freedom is $N-1=716-1=715$

Denominator degree of freedom is $NT-N-K_s=1432-716-4=712$

 $F_{0.99,715,712}=1.190496$. The critical value at the 1% significance level is $1.190496$.

Reject region is [$F>1.190496$], $F=11.68$, reject null hypothesis.
