## Questions:Column (4) contains the fixed effects estimates with cluster-robust standard errors. In the context of this sample, explain the different assumptions you are making when you estimate with and without cluster-robust standard errors. Compare the standard errors with those in column (3). Which ones are substantially different? Are the robust ones larger or smaller?
