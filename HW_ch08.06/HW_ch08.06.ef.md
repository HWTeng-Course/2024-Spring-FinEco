**Question:**\
The OLS fitted model from part (b), with usual and robust standard errors, is

$\widehat{WAGE} = -17.77 + 2.50\ EDUC + 0.23\ EXPER + 3.23\ METRO - 4.20\ FEMALE$

 | Variable |  intercept  |      EDUC     |     EXPER     |     METRO     |   FEMALE   |
 |:--------:|:-----------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:----------:|
 |    se    |    2.36     |     0.14      |      0.031    |      1.05     |    0.81    |
 |  robust  |    2.50     |     0.16      |      0.029    |      0.84     |    0.80    |

For which coefficients have interval estimates gotten narrower? For which coefficients have interval estimates gotten wider? Is there an inconsistency in the results?
