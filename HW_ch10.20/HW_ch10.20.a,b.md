## 10.20
## The CAPM [see Exercises 10.14 and 2.16] says that the risk premium on security j is related to the risk premium on the market portfolio. That is 
## $r_j - r_f = \alpha_j + \beta_j (r_m - r_f)$
## where rj and rf are the returns to security j and the risk-free rate, respectively, rm is the return on the market portfolio, and B, is the jth security's "beta" value. We measure the market portfolio using the Standard & Poor's value weighted index, and the risk-free rate by the 30-day LIBOR monthly rate of return. As noted in Exercise 10.14, if the market return is measured with error, then we face an errors-in-variables, or measurement error, problem.
