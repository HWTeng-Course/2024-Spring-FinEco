### The CAPM [see Exercises 10.14 and 2.16] says that the risk premium on security j is related to the risk premium on the market portfolio. That is $r_j - r_f = \alpha_j + \beta_j (r_m - r_f)$ where $r_j$ and $r_f$ are the returns to security j and the risk-free rate, respectively, $r_m$ is the return on the market portfolio, and $\beta_j$, is the jth security's "beta" value. We measure the market portfolio using the Standard & Poor's value weighted index, and the risk-free rate by the 30-day LIBOR monthly rate of return. As noted in Exercise 10.14, if the market return is measured with error, then we face an errors-in-variables, or measurement error, problem.

**Question:**\
Compute the first-stage residuals, $\hat{v}$, and add them to the CAPM model. Estimate the resulting augmented equation by OLS and test the significance of $\hat{v}$ at 1% level of significance. Can we conclude that the market return is exogenous?
