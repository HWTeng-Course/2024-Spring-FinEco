Q: Calculate the summary statistics for the variables: wife’s age, the number of less than 6-year-old
children, and the income from other sources than from the wife’s employment, NWIFEINC,
for the women who worked (LFP = 1) and those who did not (LFP = 0). Define NWIFEINC =
FAMINC – WAGE × HOURS. Comment on any differences you observe.

A:

Summary statistics for women who worked (LFP = 1)

Women not in the labor force are on average slightly older, and a higher income from their partners.

(b)

Q:Consider the following supply equation specification:

HOURS = $/beta1 + β2 ln(WAGE) + β3EDUC + β4AGE + β5KIDSL6 + β6KIDS618 + β7NWIFEINC + e

What signs do you expect each of the coefficients to have, and why? What does NWIFEINC
measure?
