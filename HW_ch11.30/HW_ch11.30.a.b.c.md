### 30 Example 11.3 introduces Klein’s Model I. Use the data file klein to answer the following questions.
### a.  Estimate the investment function in equation (11.18) by OLS. Comment on the signs and significance of the coefficients.

**Ans:**
We see that profits and lagged profits, P and PLAG are significant at the
5% level with the anticipated positive signs. If profits are higher firms will spend more on
investment goods. The sign of the lagged capital stock, KLAG, is negative and significant

### b. Estimate the reduced-form equation for profits, Pt, using all eight exogenous and predetermined variables as explanatory variables. Test the joint significance of all the variables except lagged profits, Pt−1, and lagged capital stock, Kt−1. Save the residuals, ̂vt and compute the fitted values, ̂Pt.

**Ans:**

### c. The Hausman test for the presence of endogenous explanatory variables is discussed in Section 10.4.1. It is implemented by adding the reduced-form residuals to the structural equation and testing their significance, that is, using OLS estimate the model 
$$I_t = b_1+b_2P_t+b_3P_{t-1}+b_4K_{t-1}+$$
