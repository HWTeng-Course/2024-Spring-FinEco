## **Question 11.29 (d)**
The Hausman test for the presence of endogenous explanatory variables is discussed in Section 10.4.1. It is implemented by adding the reduced-form residuals to the structural equation and testing their significance, that is, using OLS, estimate the model
$CN_{t} \=\alpha_{1}\+\alpha_{2}(W_{1t} +W_{2t})\+\alpha_{3}P_{t} \+\alpha_{4}P_{t−1} \+\delta_{1}\hat{\nu_{1t}}\+\delta_{2}\hat{\nu_{2t}}+e_{1t}$\
Use an $F$-test for the null hypothesis$H0∶δ1 =0,δ2 =0$ at the 5% level of significance. By rejecting the null hypothesis, we conclude that either W1t or Pt is endogenous, or both are endogenous. What do we conclude from the test? In the context of this simultaneous equations model what result should we find?
