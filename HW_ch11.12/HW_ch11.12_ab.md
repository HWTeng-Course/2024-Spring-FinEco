## Supppose you want to estimate a wage equation for married women of the form $ln(wage) = \beta_1+\beta_2HOURS+\beta_3EDUC+\beta_4EXPER+\beta_5EXPER^2+e_i$where WAGE is the hourly wage, HOURS is number of hours worked per week, EDUC is years of education, and EXPER is years of experience. Your classmate observes that higher wages can bring forth increaseed work effort, and that married women with small children may reduce their hours of work to take care of them. It may also be true that a husband's wage rate has an effect on a wife's hours of work supplied, sot that there may be an anxuiliary relationship such as $HOURS = \alpha_1+\alpha_2ln(WAGE)+\alpha_3KIDS+\alpha_4ln(HWAGE)$ where KIDS is the number of children under the age of six in the woman's household and HWAGE is her husband's wage rate.
