### Let y = expenditure($) on food away from home per household member per month in the past quarter and x = monthly household income(in hundreds of dollars) during the past year.

**Question (a)**\
Using 2013 data from three-person households (N = 2334), we obtain least squares estimates $\hat{y}$ = 13.77 + 0.52x. Interpret the estimated slope and intercept from this relation.

**Ans:**\
Intercept 13.77 means when monthly household income equals 0, on average, expenditure on food away would be 13.77 dollars. And slope 0.52 means when monthly household income increases 100 hundred dollars, expenditure on food away would increase 0.52 dollars on average.

**Question (b)**\
Predict the expenditures on food away from home for a household with $2000 amonth income.

**Ans:**\
We know that when household income is $2000 per month, the expenditure on food away per month on average is $24.17.

**Sample code**
```
y = 13.77 + 0.52 * 2000 / 100
y
```
