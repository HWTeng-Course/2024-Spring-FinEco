Question:\
Consider the data file mroz on working wives. Use the 428 observations on married women who participate in the labor force. In this exercise, we examine the effectiveness of a parent’s college education as an instrumental variable.

## 10.18 (e)

Question:\
Estimate the wage equation in Example 10.5 using MOTHERCOLL and FATHERCOLL as the instrumental variables. What is the 95% interval estimate for the coefficient of EDUC? Is it nar- rower or wider than the one in part (c)?

Answer:\
The wage equation in Example 10.5 is $\ln(\text{WAGE}) = \beta_1 + \beta_2 \text{EXPER} + \beta_3 \text{EXPER}^2 + \beta_4 \text{EDUC} + \epsilon$\
In the repeated sampling, the 95% interval estimate for the coefficient of EDUC using MOTHERCOLL and FATHERCOLL as the instrumental variables is [0.02752 0.1482].\
So we can konw that the 95% interval is slightly narrower than the one in part(c).
