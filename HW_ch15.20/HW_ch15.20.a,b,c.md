## This exercise uses data from the STAR experiment introduced to illustrate fixed and random effects for grouped data. In the STAR experiment, children were randomly assigned within schools into three types of classes: small classes with 13–17 students, regular-sized classes with 22–25 students, and regular-sized classes with a full-time teacher aide to assist the teacher. Student scores on achievement tests were recorded as well as some information about the students, teachers, and schools. Data for the kindergarten classes are contained in the data file star.

**Question** \
Estimate a regression equation (with no fixed or random effects) where READSCORE is related to SMALL, AIDE, TCHEXPER, BOY, WHITE_ASIAN, and FREELUNCH. Discuss the results. Do students perform better in reading when they are in small classes? Does a teacher’s aide improve scores? Do the students of more experienced teachers score higher on reading tests? Does the student’s sex or race make a difference?
