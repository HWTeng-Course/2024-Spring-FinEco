**Question**\
Using the t-test statistic in equation (15.36) and a 5% significance level, test whether there are any
significant differences between the fixed effects and random effects estimates of the coefficients
on SMALL, AIDE, TCHEXPER, WHITE_ASIAN, and FREELUNCH. What are the implications
of the test outcomes? What happens if we apply the test to the fixed and random effects estimates of
the coefficient on BOY?

The results of the Hausman test indicate that the null hypothesis is rejected at the 5% significance level, suggesting that there is a difference between the fixed effects and random effects, and the fixed effects model should be used.
