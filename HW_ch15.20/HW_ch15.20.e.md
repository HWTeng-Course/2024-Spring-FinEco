**Question**\
Using the t-test statistic in equation (15.36) and a 5% significance level, test whether there are any
significant differences between the fixed effects and random effects estimates of the coefficients
on SMALL, AIDE, TCHEXPER, WHITE_ASIAN, and FREELUNCH. What are the implications
of the test outcomes? What happens if we apply the test to the fixed and random effects estimates of
the coefficient on BOY?
