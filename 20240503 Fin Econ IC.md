## Q1. 

Find the MM in the simple linear regression $y=\beta_1+\beta_2 x + \varepsilon$. Suppose that $x$ is endogenous and  $z$ is a good IV.
1. How many parameters in the simple linear regression
2. Write down the two moments conditions. 
3. Express the two moments in step 2 using paremeters.
4. Express parameters using moments. 
5. Write down the MM estimators for $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$. 



## Q2. 

If the model is

$y=\beta_1+\beta_2x_2+\beta_3x_3+\beta_4 x_4+ e$
where $x_2$ is exogenous, but $x_3$ and $x_4$ are exogenous. 

If we have three IVs, $z_1$, $z_2$, and $z_3$. 

Suppose we use all these three IVs. 

1. Write down the first equation in the 2SLS.
2. Write down the second equation.
